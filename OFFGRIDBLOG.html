        <h2> I'm a 46 year old New Yorker, and have been interested in the offgrid lifestyle since I was an
            Art student in 1991. Living offgrid you face many challenges and a reoccuring theme is technology, and my
            own epiphany came to me while I was living in a Cretan cave, near Matala in the south of the Island of
            Crete. I lived For 6 months in that cave, but I had already lived for ( months on the legendary Island of
            Gavdos so cave life was easy! My journey to CodeNation literally began life as an idea in a cave on a
            Mediterranean island. My training has been frustratingly brilliant! Alittle too much too fast but just when
            you feel lost-you suddenly "get it" as you progress through the sausage factory...</h2>

The lack of&nbsp;Business Process Transformation&nbsp;insight when it comes to large digital and IT projects creates inefficiencies, unintended consequences, and can often inhibit the adoption of new digital products.

The thing about technology, however, is that it comprises a wide variety of options and solutions and the key is finding the “right” solution for your needs. You want to make choices that let you focus on your core business, not on the technology that helps operate it.

           <h2> Tools such as Trello, GitHub, have proved useful as Trello aids organisation and github allows remote access from anywhere in the world-perfect for dislocated teams working together but from different locations. Unfortunately I don't truly have any "chosen technologies" I'm relying on what us students are told to use, but clearly they are useful and popular tools otherwise we wouldn't be using them! Git is the language that allows you to put information into GitHub. Slack has been the interface between us students and the tutors, we can message each other and updates can be loaded and read by all relevant parties.

            <h1 class="unitTitles">unit 1.7:Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? :</h1>
            <h2> GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation.According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address.The 8 basic rights of GDPR
                    Under the GDPR, individuals have:
                    
                    The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.
                    The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
                    The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
                    The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
                    The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.
                    The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
                    The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
                    The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.
                    The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.
                    
                    The business implications of GDPR
                    This new data protection regulation puts the consumer in the driver’s seat, and the task of complying with this regulation falls upon businesses and organizations. Otherwise, you’re failing to comply.What falls under GDPR compliance?

                    Well, GDPR applies to all businesses and organizations established in the EU, regardless of whether the data processing takes place in the EU or not. Even non-EU established organizations will be subject to GDPR. If your business offers goods and/ or services to citizens in the EU, then it’s subject to GDPR.
                    
                    All organizations and companies that work with personal data should appoint a data protection officer or data controller who is in charge of GDPR compliance.
                    
                    There are tough penalties for those companies and organizations who don’t comply with GDPR fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater.
                    
                    How serious is the EU taking GDPR?
                    
                    Extremely seriously.
                    
                    For example, both British Airways and Marriott International are facing eye-watering fines that amount to hundreds of millions or euros for failing to comply.
                    
                    British Airways are facing fines of up to €200 million for a data breach that occurred in September 2018
                    Marriott International are expected to be fined in the region of €99 million for a data breach between 2014 and 2018
                    Now, many people might think that the GDPR is just an IT issue, but that is the furthest from the truth. It has broad-sweeping implications for the whole company, including the way companies handle marketing and sales activities.
                    
                    The impact of GDPR on customer engagement
                    The conditions for obtaining consent are stricter under GDPR requirements as the individual must have the right to withdraw consent at any time and there is a presumption that consent will not be valid unless separate consents are obtained for different processing activities.
                    
                    This means you have to be able to prove that the individual agreed to a certain action, to receive a newsletter for instance. It is not allowed to assume or add a disclaimer, and providing an opt-out option is not enough.(apologies that this answer isn't as compact as the others but I was required to cover the law-plus I wanted my own persoonal future reference too.)
