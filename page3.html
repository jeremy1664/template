        <h1>Outcome 1.6 </h1><h2>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.<p>How To Design Websites For Blind/Visually Impaired, Deaf, Disabled & Dyslexic Visitors(https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/design-website-for-blind/) What is accessibility?: However, it is wrong to say that accessibility is just about disabilities. Really, the aim of accessibility is to make your websites/apps usable by as many people in as many contexts as possible, not just those users using high-powered desktop computers. Some examples might include:

                Users on mobile devices.
                Users on alternative browsing devices such as TVs, watches, etc.
                Users of older devices that might not have the latest browsers.
                Users of lower spec devices that might have slow processors.
                In a way, this whole module is about accessibility — cross browser testing makes sure that your sites can be used by as many people as possible. What is accessibility? defines accessibility more completely and thoroughly than this article does. Yet another form of access issues may involve age restriction for adult content, alcohol etc</p>

Here, we have a list of the file types, along with the applications you’ll need to get them going on your computer.
