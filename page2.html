        <h1>Review 2.1 </h1><h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website,
            are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.<p>
                I have nothing to compare the IT tools I'm using to! I have come here to learn from scratch, ground zero-I don't even own a computer yet.
                My usage is Google, Yahoo mail, Facebook, Skype, and Youtube, so I'm delighted that I am now able to actually program a computer to do what I want it to perform for me, like creating an App, a Blog and a Website!
                To be able to comprehend and do this in just 15 days is staggering to me!!! The tools are great although I'm not refering to trello etc as much as I should because my knowledge is very limited and I'm constantly worried about time... some students have been programming for months, others years, others at university or had office jobs are far more familiar with coimputers and computing than me so I do struggle with time as I didn't even know how to create and open a file!

        <h1>
            Review 2.2 </h1><h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.<p>
                All the IT tools recommended to us were fit for purpose as expected, the course is too concentrated to allow me time to experiment and play with these fantastic tools, I hope to learn more on the Master course.

        <h1>
            Review 2.3 </h1><h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why?
            Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?<p>
                I'm delighted that I have made a working prototype project. Generally I'm happy with it, although a bit wacky and annoying (and distracting) my aim was to integrate as many styles etc as possible-just so that I knew how it worked. Using flex the "wrap" function is great for the background however there is a distinct line where the images join, I'd like that to be invisible and seamless. 
            </p>

        <h1>
            Review 2.4 </h1><h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project.<p>
                make the flex-wrap seamless, improve the styling; I'd like the photos to scale up and down to follow the size of the screens used etc, I want to add a slideshow too as I want this to be a working template for me to use and build upon in the near future. I will actually get this up and running.
            </p>

            <h1>
                Review 2.5</h1> <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.<p>
                    I believe all outcomes match and are fit for purpose, so far all the links from page to page work, the link works etc.

                    UNIT 1, OUTCOME 3 (REVIEWS)
                </h1>
                <h1>Review 3.1 </h1> Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? <h2><p>
                    Xcode is very buggy so it can cause as many problems as it solves, especially whem yoiu are new, inexperienced and don't understand the difference between me making a mistake and the program having a bug...if I had experience I would know my programming was correct and deduce that there was a problem elsewhere but I'm not at that stage yet! One thing that I have learned is that all programs have their own "formats" so a photo or gif that runs in one program will not always work on another so eiother need to select another image with a different "file type" ie .jpg, .gif, .png etc to make them compatible. With my lack of experience I don't think I could have been more efficient while making my website, but if I could-I think if I only focussed on doing 100% of the contenmt first, and work on the styling afterwards, perhaps this would be more efficient? Teams would have helped do it quickly and efficiently but then I wouldn't know how to do it myself from scratch so it would be beneficial to the webpage being created but detrimental to my understanding of how its made. 
                <h1>Review 3.2 </h1> Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  <h2><p>
                    Work in "chunks", design all content ideas and have all the content ready to go, file all images needed, so you can complete task after task, one by one-until completion. put time constraints on each task so that ideas got completed ahead of time, on time or behind schedule so that you can keep focus and not drift off.
                    Upload the project onto github so that you can work remotely at anytime. The best way to increase efficiency is to increase training, knowledge and experience working with these tools!
                </p></h2>
                <h1>Review 3.3 </h1> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?<h2><p>
I feel it is organisation that is key to improved productivity and that for the purposes of this task, and for me it's actually ignoring the IT elements, and simply typing out all the content so that it is ready for IT styling etc afterwards. teamwork clearly would've speeded up this task but it's irrelevant here as this project was a solo effort.
                </p></h2>
                <h1>Review 3.4 </h1> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions <h2><p>
                    I keep the program running so changes happen in real time and can be seen operating(or not). Our tutor Dan told us how he likes to use background colours when designing so that all areas are clearly defined as opposed to designing on a blank white page where you can't see the perameters, limitations etc. I would google search testing digital solutions to discover new ways of thing and viewing the problem.
